# OSN Assignment 4

xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern RISC-V multiprocessor using ANSI C.

## TODO

- [ ] fix strace for child processes

## Features Implemented

### Syscalls Implemented
- **trace:** Implemented syscall `trace` which turns on the tracing mode for a process. During tracing for all syscalls called and specified in the mask, their arguement list and return value is printed.
- **sigalarm** Implemented syscall `sigalarm` which sets an alarm flag, an alarm interval `n` and an alarm handler `fn` to be called for the process at every `n` ticks.
- **sigreturn** Implemented syscall `sigreturn` which restores the state of the process to before the last alarm handler was called. It is supposed to be called at the end of the handler by the handler.
- **settickets**(for LBS only) Implemented syscall `settickets` which sets the number of tickets of a process to the given value. It can be used to increase or decrease the probability of a process being scheduled in LBS.

### Programs Written
- **strace:** `strace <mask> <command>`, executes command `command` and traces all syscalls specified in the mask `mask`.

xv6 is inspired by John Lions's Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition (Peer
to Peer Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14,
2000)).  See also https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.1810/, which provides

## ERROR REPORTS

Please send errors and suggestions to Frans Kaashoek and Robert Morris
(kaashoek,rtm@mit.edu).  The main purpose of xv6 is as a teaching
operating system for MIT's 6.1810, so we are more interested in
simplifications and clarifications than new features.

## BUILDING AND RUNNING XV6

You will need a RISC-V "newlib" tool chain from
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain, and qemu compiled for
riscv64-softmmu.  Once they are installed, and in your shell
search path, you can run "make qemu".
